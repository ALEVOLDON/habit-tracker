# Instruction for Cursor AI

Please perform the following tasks across the entire project:

1. **Codebase Audit**:
   - Go through all files and components.
   - Identify what has already been implemented and works.
   - List any unfinished, missing, or placeholder features.
   - Highlight any bugs, bad practices, or performance issues.

2. **Suggestions and TODO List**:
   - Based on the audit, generate a structured TODO list for the project.
   - Prioritize critical features (e.g., habit creation, tracking logic, persistent storage).
   - Include improvements for UI/UX, code structure, and any missing documentation.

3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Start implementing missing features one by one.
   - Focus on atomic, clean commits with clear commit messages.
   - Use best practices for React + Vite + TypeScript projects.
   - Ensure the final product is functional, deployable, and easy to use.

4. **Optional Enhancements** (if core is ready):
   - Add basic testing (e.g., with Vitest or React Testing Library).
   - Add localStorage or Firebase support for saving habits.
   - Improve mobile responsiveness.

5. **Final Touch**:
   - Update `README.md` with proper setup instructions.
   - Add comments and docs for easier understanding.
   - Ensure ESLint and Prettier are working.
